# Blue Team Lab: Real-World Detection Scenarios

## Overview  
This project demonstrates a hands-on lab where I tested and validated my Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) setup using real-world attack simulations. The goal was to build an end-to-end detection and alerting workflow to strengthen my skills as a SOC analyst.

## What I Did  

### Scenario 1: Brute Force Login Detection  
- Simulated a brute force attack by entering the wrong password five times on a Windows victim machine.  
- Configured the SIEM (Splunk) to generate immediate email alerts on repeated failed login attempts using Windows Security Event Logs (Event ID 4625).  

### Scenario 2: LLMNR Spoofing Attack Detection  
- Performed an LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) spoofing attack from a Kali Linux VM using the Responder tool.  
- Monitored network traffic in Wireshark to observe malicious LLMNR responses.  
- Configured the SIEM to send real-time phone alerts for suspicious network activity indicating LLMNR poisoning.

## What I Learned  

- How to build and test SIEM detection rules based on Windows and network logs.  
- Real attacker techniques and how they manifest in logs and traffic.  
- The importance of rapid alerting and incident response workflows in a SOC environment.  
- Strengthened understanding of networking fundamentals and Windows security as I prepare for Security+ certification.

## Active Directory Lab — LLMNR & Brute Force Detection

This lab focuses on attacker behavior in a Windows domain and detecting that behavior with Splunk, Sysmon, and network monitoring tools.

*This lab helped me grow from theory to practice by simulating attacks, detecting them in real-time, and responding quickly — key skills for a SOC analyst.*
